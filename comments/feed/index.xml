		<description><![CDATA[Hi West - Definitely! You can reset Kuri&#039;s map at any point for home moves, bringing your robot to a friend&#039;s house, or furniture changes. It&#039;s super easy to re-map Kuri and teach her a new home layout. Unfortunately, Kuri cannot answer questions or set alarms. If you&#039;re interested in learning more about Kuri&#039;s communication style, we recommend checking this blog post out: https://blog.heykuri.com/understanding-kuri-speaks/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will it be possible for Kuri to learn a new floor-plan if her family moves houses?  Would she need to be reset in order to do so, or will there perhaps be an option for accomplishing this?  Also, it was mentioned previously that Kuri can learn new tasks.  What sorts of new tasks might she be able to learn?  Also also, will Kuri be able to set alarms and go to different rooms to wake people up?  Will she also be able to answer yes or no questions, such as if it will rain?  Sorry for asking so many questions!  I look forward to receiving Kuri later this Summer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jennifer - You&#039;re correct, Kuri has shipped. As a customer, you&#039;re already familiar with Kuri Vision: Kuri&#039;s ability to take 5-second video moments around your home each day. The customers that currently own Kuri have been encouraged to share these moments on social media using #HeyKuri. We invite you to search for those posts! However, please keep in mind that some people prefer to keep such moments to themselves, which is something we fully respect. As more Kuri robots make their way to customers&#039; homes this summer, we expect to see more moments widely shared on social media.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am expecting my Kuri in June or July but I’d like to see some posts on the FB page or here from people who already have Kuri. I want to know their opinions on how Kuri was worth or not worth the investment. I am becoming a little weary since I don’t see any real-owner reviews or posts when it is my understanding that some Kuri’s already shipped!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kuri, 
You’ve grown so fast! Even though I’m waiting , to see the advances you continue to make only evolving you into a better Kuri. I hope  you can communicate with my dog. She loves to play fetch!
I can’t wait. I work for Apple, no Kuri there! I hope you’ll have the ability to be open to both iOS and PC. So excited!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little (haha) behind with &quot;non-critical&quot; emails, but this brought a huge smile to my face 2 weeks after the fact... at first I was pleasantly baffled that our bright Engineers would come up with these 3 gadgets as viable options. But what a perfect ending to the response chain, I truly hope the Team can implement some useful services for the disabled. Patiently waiting the next delivery cycle, June 27 is my birthday;)]]></description>
