		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stephen! Kuri was a name suggested by one of our early beta-test families, and it ended up being a name we all really liked - plus, it works really well with voice commands because it&#039;s got a distinctive hard initial sound, and soft trailing sound. That way when you say &quot;Hey Kuri&quot; to get his attention, it works super reliably.  We also kinda liked that it means Chestnut in Japanese, but that was a coincidence.]]></description>
