		<description><![CDATA[You won&#039;t be able to get Kuri to respond to a different name for voice commands because building a customized &quot;wake word&quot; is actually a lot of work. In the future, maybe robots will be able to learn new words as fast as we do, but for now Kuri&#039;s name isn&#039;t something you can change (unless you&#039;re ok with a robot that doesn&#039;t listen to you)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for responding so quickly. That&#039;s interesting to hear, although I think I might default to &quot;it&quot; with less difficulty (in part because much science fiction I&#039;ve read does encompass the non-gendered machine as nonetheless social). From your perspective, and comfort, using he and she interchangeably seems to make sense, and might be helpful for people reading about Kuri (although maybe a note would help people notice the changes as an overt strategy for individual connection).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The flipping between he and she on the website is intentional: around the office here, we all agree it&#039;s either he or she, but never &quot;it&quot;. But we couldn&#039;t agree on he vs she, so we just picked both, and that seems to be working out pretty well. We&#039;re thrilled that it&#039;s become one of Kuri&#039;s conversation points, and shows how open people are to connect with robots like Kuri.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although the Tech Crunch report on Kuri (earlier this year) notes that most marketing and discussions gender this robot male, on this website I can see that you switch between referring to Kuri as &quot;he&quot; and then &quot;she&quot; on a regular basis. I&#039;d love to know if this is a strategy of some kind, or whether it depends on who is writing the content. (I&#039;m interested in whether robots can be regarded as having no gender (&quot;it&quot;) and yet still promote social connections with people.)]]></description>
