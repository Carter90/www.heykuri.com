		<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael - Fair point. We&#039;re sorry you&#039;re disappointed, and frankly, our team is too. We received a ton of enthusiasm for Kuri&#039;s pre-orders. That, combined with the difficulty of building home robots, led to a delay in some pre-order customers&#039; shipments. We&#039;re really proud of the new features we&#039;ve introduced on Kuri since CES 2017, and hope they add value to your home once your Kuri ships this spring. We appreciate you being a Kuri supporter and apologize for the delay.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was super excited when I heard about Kuri introduction at the 2017 CES.... So much so I pre-ordered my Kuri on January 22, 2017. I thought I would for certain receive my very own Kuri in time for the holidays... But to my disappointment I received a email stating my pre order would not ship out until spring of 2018. I thought the whole point of pre ordering in advance is to make certain that you actually receive it in advance.]]></description>
