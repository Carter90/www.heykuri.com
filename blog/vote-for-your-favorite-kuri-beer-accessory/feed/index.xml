		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little (haha) behind with &quot;non-critical&quot; emails, but this brought a huge smile to my face 2 weeks after the fact... at first I was pleasantly baffled that our bright Engineers would come up with these 3 gadgets as viable options. But what a perfect ending to the response chain, I truly hope the Team can implement some useful services for the disabled. Patiently waiting the next delivery cycle, June 27 is my birthday;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you 100%! I am disabled.  While I love the idea of having  Kuri  in my home as a companion and possible watch dog-recording  things that I won’t see that might  go on in my house, it would be nice if he did have some extended functionality in the future.   Even though being adorable is  awesome, the companion side of it.  I think it would be an extra bonus if he were able to deliver small items like medicines or  a  beverage that  would be nice. Sometimes, I drop small objects like toothpaste caps or coins or pills  on the carpet  and have difficulty locating them again.  If Kuri could have some kind of “find it“ feature where you could ask him how close you are to the object in the floor with your hand or even with his body by making a rising  or falling  Tone   as he or your hand which( ever  would be easier to implement) gets nearer to the object, that would be an interesting feature.  Probably programmatically impossible, but an interesting feature.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good idea to be able to carry/deliver something to someone in the house. Kuri with expanded uses makes it that much more valuable. Nice if someone is sick, have to deliver a bottle of orange juice or something else to someone laying on the sofa.]]></description>
