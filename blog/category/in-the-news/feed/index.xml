Focused on personality and connection, these women spent the next three years developing a new kind of robot for the home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At Mayfield, our core team defies the gender norm. We&#8217;re particularly proud of how many viciously bright women we have in leadership roles.

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>&#8220;Currently, home robotics is perceived in the context of either some sort of digitized assistant or a simple, utilitarian tool for cleaning. But Kuri, an “insanely cute&#8221; robot, leaves the user feeling like home robots are commonplace, friendly, and welcoming.&#8221; &#8211;Kaijen Hsiao</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Leading the conversation on consumer expectations, technical limitations and designing a robot with </span>personality<span style="font-size: 14pt;">, Hsiao was recently published in <a href="http://www.gereports.com/future-home-robotics-capable-personable-cute/">GE Perspectives as a guest writer</a>, reporting on what it’s like to design a loveable robot for the home. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Along with Hsiao and Osentoski, Mayfield&#8217;s Sr. Mechanical Engineer Stephanie Lee has been instrumental in the design and creation of Kuri.

<p>Mayfield Robotics co-founders Kaijen Hsiao and Sarah Osentoski were both named in Silicon Valley Business Journal&#8217;s 2017 list of &#8220;100 Women of Influence&#8221;. Both Sarah, COO, and Kaijen, CTO, have spent over 15 years in advanced robotics research and manufacturing with experience in global leadership roles at leading companies including Bosch and Willow Garage.  We&#8217;re super excited that they were recognized with this honor; their awards speak to their strength and passion for leadership. Among the other Women selected were leaders from companies including Adobe, Swinerton Builders, eBay, NASA Ames, Microsoft, Fetch Robotics, Cisco, and Intuit.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-240 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-17-at-2.44.39-PM.png" width="170" height="171" /></p>
<p>We asked Sarah and Kaijen what they though about being named to this list, here&#8217;s what they told us:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Sarah</strong>: &#8220;We have a very diverse team here at Mayfield Robotics. We&#8217;re about 50% women and our team crosses a wide range of cultures and backgrounds. It&#8217;s a big part of how we can create technology that is not only useful, but also joyful. We cover a full range of emotional connections, and we couldn&#8217;t do that without the strength and diversity of our team. I&#8217;m honored to win this award, and I hope that everyone who was named here is able to act as an inspiring force to other women to succeed in their careers. Working in a new field like robotics can be challenging in so many ways, so it&#8217;s really energizing for Kaijen and I to have both been recognized. I see it as strong validation for the pioneering work we&#8217;ve both been doing for over 15 years.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Kaijen</strong>: &#8220;I always love to read about all the other women on these lists. It&#8217;s inspiring to me to know that there are so many other women out there who work so hard to make a difference. I&#8217;m friends with some of the other women who were recognized, and I&#8217;m really happy that we can all share this. Like Sarah said, I agree that the diversity of our team at Mayfield Robotics is an important part of what makes what we do possible. I&#8217;m also proud to be a woman in leadership who can help to bring home robotics to life in ways that have never been done before. All the women on this list share that in common: we&#8217;re all pushing new boundaries.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-245 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blog3_SK.jpg" alt="" width="675" height="506" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sarah and Kaijen will be accepting their awards at the SVBJ awards gala on the evening of May 18th in San Jose. For information and tickets <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/event/160612/2017/women-of-influence-awards">click here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="id_deck">Americans are wary of robots, but lovable ones like Kuri could help us welcome these helpful androids into our homes.</h2>
<p>Robots used to be the stuff of science fiction. Not so much anymore. At CES, you can even find an entire section of the floor dedicated to them. Even so, robots aren&#8217;t usually the starring attraction of CES—though Kuri by Mayfield Robotics is doing it&#8217;s best to challenge that.</p>
<p>I got my first glimpse of Kuri at CES Unveiled and, it&#8217;s true, my initial interest was based on the robot&#8217;s cuteness. The design is reminiscent of pop culture&#8217;s favorite robot personalities: R2-D2, BB-8, Wall-E, and EVE. All simple lines and curves, with the added bonus of cheerful beeps and bloops, Kuri is the exact opposite of the vaguely apocalyptic implications that talk of the Singularity usually brings. A simple pat to Kuri&#8217;s head was greeted with a robotic chirp, happy eyes, and a warm glow in his LED chest. If you booped Kuri&#8217;s base, he would stutter back confused, head glancing from side to side, eyes blinking rapidly, as if to suss out what had happened.</p>
<div>
<div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="http://www6.pcmag.com/media/images/529071-kuri.jpg?thumb=y" alt="Kuri" /></div>
</div>
<p>These are all expressions and descriptions that you&#8217;d find antithetical to a &#8220;robot.&#8221; Even cute robots like Softbank&#8217;s Pepper or Honda&#8217;s Asimo are still oddly detached and somewhat unnatural. They&#8217;re technologically impressive but at the same time, you can&#8217;t really imagine them being your friend, let alone living in your house with pets and children. So what immediately stood out about Kuri was how easy it was to personify and empathize with him—starting with simple pronouns like &#8220;him&#8221; or &#8220;her&#8221; instead of &#8220;it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a demo, Mayfield Robotics explained that this is all part of the plan. Because Kuri was envisioned as a personal assistant robot, it had to be something that you could relate to and would feel comfortable having in your home every day. So while a lot of the functionality is similar to other smart home devices—streaming feeds of your house, audio, facial and speech recognition, etc.—the building block for Kuri wasn&#8217;t the technology, but the design. Personality, not specs.</p>
<p>This is evident in the little flourishes Mayfield Robotics has added. When demonstrating Kuri&#8217;s ability to navigate around a backpack and into a kitchenette, you can see that the robot looks left, as you or I would, before turning. And, instead of smoothly gliding across the floor, Kuri has a little waddle that looks like it jumped straight out of a Pixar film.</p>
<div>
<div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="http://www1.pcmag.com/media/images/529115-kuri-robot.jpg?thumb=y" alt="Kuri Robot" /></div>
</div>
<p>If you issue a voice command that Kuri doesn&#8217;t understand, his chest will light up yellow and he&#8217;ll shake his head in confusion. If you or a family member walks in the door, Kuri can be programmed to waddle up to you and &#8220;smile&#8221; at you in greeting. You get the same response when you issue a command, which makes saying &#8220;Hey Kuri&#8221; infinitely more satisfying than saying &#8220;Hey Siri.&#8221; After spending just 45 minutes with Kuri, it was impossible to walk away without feeling the same kind of affection one might feel for a puppy walking down the street.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be easy for a cynic to look at the $699 price tag and say, &#8220;Okay, so what if it&#8217;s cute? What&#8217;s the point?&#8221; Well, for years Japan has been leading the charge in personal assistant robots. This is partly because as a culture, the Japanese view the future of robots as friendly helpers rather than potential Terminator-esque overlords. In the West, aside from perhaps the <em>Star Wars</em> films, robots have frequently been portrayed as soulless, logic-driven machines that eventually learn to overthrow their imperfect and illogical creators.</p>
<p>And as such, Western robots tend to be impressive from an engineering standpoint like Boston Dynamics&#8217;s Atlas, but rather impersonal. So for an American-based company to be the creators of Kuri is somewhat of a pleasant surprise. Perhaps even a possible sign that the rise of the robots doesn&#8217;t have to be quite so ominous.</p>
<div>
<div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="http://www7.pcmag.com/media/images/529116-kuri-robot.jpg?thumb=y" alt="Kuri Robot" /></div>
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s also telling what Kuri doesn&#8217;t do. When asked how he&#8217;d describe Kuri&#8217;s personality, Mayfield Robotics CEO Mike Beebe said &#8220;earnest, curious, and humble.&#8221; It&#8217;s simply not in Kuri&#8217;s programming to get angry, snarky, or spiteful. And when it came to figuring out Kuri&#8217;s functionality, there were some features that Mayfield decided against including as it wouldn&#8217;t jibe with Kuri&#8217;s personality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little too early to tell whether Kuri will help spark a more Jetsonian future. While you can pre-order Kuri with a deposit of $100, Mayfield Robotics doesn&#8217;t expect they&#8217;ll be ready until the holiday season for 2017. It&#8217;s also hard to judge just how much consumers will be willing to pay for what, at this point in time, is first-adopter novelty technology. But if robot maids, nannies, and companions are in our future, then Kuri&#8217;s personality-first approach is worth emulating.</p>

<p>Smart home robotics is a burgeoning field, and it’s no surprise that it’s a space ripe for disruption.</p>
<p>Mayfield Robotics, an independent subsidiary of appliance company Bosch, unveiled the Kuri at the Consumer Electronics Show on Tuesday. The 20-inch-tall, 12-inch-wide home robot is packed to the brim with technologies like asynchronous motors, a capacitive touch sensor, microphones, speakers, and an HD camera. But Kuri is a little more amiable than your average robot. It animates playfully when you call its name. It emotes audibly when instructed to perform a task. And a built-in LED changes color to indicate its current state of mood.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-143" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Blog-Kuri-TechCrunch-1024x320.jpg" alt="Kuri Home Robot featured in TechCrunch" width="618" height="193" /></p>
<p>Mayfield sought to build a robot that’d feel less like a piece of technology and more like a “companion” — a point Chris Matthews, Mayfield’s vice president of marketing, emphasized in a sit-down at Digital Trends’ New York office in November.  “It doesn’t feel like a robot in the traditional sense. It connects to people a different way than normal tech,” Matthews said. “It’s very much about what people feel.”</p>
<p>Mayfield’s humanistic approach to design is the result of exhaustive research. The company, the first Bosch spinoff founded outside of its home country of Germany, was founded with a two-pronged mission — to investigate the home robotics space, and to apply what it learned toward the development of its own product.</p>
<div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="http://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/mayfield_robot_25-720x720.jpg" /></div>
<p>The Redwood City, California-based team got to work quickly. Mayfield’s six employees — two former Bosch roboticists, a CEO, and software engineers — built a home robot from the ground up, focusing on three pillars: mobility, awareness, and personality.</p>
<p>To those ends, the company designed Kuri with the ability to express human-like emotions. They eschewed a screen, instead opting for an animated spherical “head” and “eyelids” — articulated plastic frames over the robot’s “eyes” — that rely on a vertical lift and six motors. And they engineered a high-definition camera capable of “remembering” people the robot’s seen.</p>
<p>But the Kuri won’t be mistaken for a human anytime soon. The diminutive robot responds with chirps and squawks instead of human speech, a limitation of its underlying technology. “As soon as it starts talking and responding to a human voice, the level of expectation goes up,” Matthews said.</p>
<p>Those sounds are driven by dual speakers, which can also serve as a Bluetooth-connected speaker. Kuri’s primary interface, voice recognition, is enabled by a dedicated processor and 4-microphone array that responds to a wake phrase — “Hey Kuri” — and 12 other basic commands.</p>
<p>Voice recognition dovetails with Kuri’s ability to “recall” its surroundings. Thanks to a laser-depth system that tracks the location of walls and furniture at the millimeter level, Kuri is able to build a digital, room-by-room map of its surrounding environment. And real-time tracking prevents it from colliding with objects in its way.</p>
<p>In a demo at the Consumer Electronics Show, Matthews instructed a Kuri unit to travel from a hotel suite kitchen to a living room with a verbal command, and then placed a backpack in its path. The robot identified the bag en route and slowly, cautiously moved around it.</p>
<p>Small electric motors power Kuri’s movement. The two large castor wheels — big enough to handle flooring, carpets, leather, area rugs, and transitions between them, according to Matthews — are the result of years of engineering. The first few prototypes featured four-wheel drive and used spheres as drive wheels, a combination that led to instability issues. “It basically fell over on its side,” Matthews said.</p>
<p>Kuri isn’t entirely autonomous. All of the robot’s functions can be remotely controlled via a smartphone companion app: its motors via a virtual trackpad, its speakers through the smartphone’s microphone, and its camera via a dedicated “record” button. And most of that content is stored for later perusal on Mayfield’s cloud storage. “You’ll be able to see wherever Kuri’s been some number of days,” Matthews said, “and save and share your favorite moments.”</p>
<p>What the Kuri has in hardware and software, though, it unfortunately lacks in third-party support. It’ll interface with If This Then That (IFTT), a web-based service that allows users to link disparate internet-connected services and hardware such as Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, Google Home, and Logitech’s Harmony Hub. And it’ll launch without smart home partnerships with platforms like like SmartThings and Philips Hue.</p>
<p>“We want to ship a complete product — one that’s useful for everybody. We’ll keep making it better,” Matthews said. “We want to build robots that are joyful, useful, and inspiring. Kuri moves, listens, sees, speaks, and entertains. We worked hard to make sure we were hitting on those three chords.”</p>
<p>Mayfield Robotics is ensuring a level of development transparency. Starting Wednesday, it’s embarking on a yearlong development process that’ll see the Kuri’s software and hardware improve weekly. The research team will post regular updates on progress, and solicit feedback from both customers and the broader public.</p>
<p>Kuri is available for pre-order starting Wednesday at HeyKuri.com with a $100 deposit. It’ll retail for $700 next year, and ship with a dedicated charging dock.</p>

<h4>As seen in IEEE Spectrum, written by <span class="s1">Evan Ackerman</span></h4>
</div>

</div>
<p>Designed by Mayfield Robotics, Kuri is “an intelligent robot for the home.”</p>
<div>
<p>For about two years now, <a href="http://www.mayfieldrobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayfield Robotics</a> has been working on something. A robot, we’d heard. Something helpful for the home. Not a vacuum. No screen, but a face. Without much in the way of (public) information on this secret robot, what kept us interested was <a href="http://www.mayfieldrobotics.com/team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the team</a>: chief technical officer and cofounder Kaijen Hsiao spent almost four years at Willow Garage, and cofounder and chief operating officer Sarah Osentoski led robotics R&amp;D projects at Bosch for four years, including working with Bosch’s beta program PR2. And with funding from Bosch’s Startup Platform, Mayfield has been able to hire an enormous team of people, about 40 of them, in just a couple of years without making any public announcements whatsoever.</p>
<p>Today, Mayfield is introducing Kuri, “an intelligent robot for the home.” Kuri is half a meter tall, weighs just over 6 kilograms, and is “designed with personality, awareness, and mobility, [that] adds a spark of life to any home.”</p>
<div></div>
<p>Kuri has some fairly sophisticated technology inside of it. Besides what you’d expect (a camera, microphone array, speakers, and touch sensors), Kuri also has some sort of “laser-based sensor array” that it uses for obstacle detection, localization, and navigation. If Kuri can map your house by itself and then remember where things are, that would be slick, and we’re looking forward to seeing how much autonomy is there. We’re also unsure how much of what Kuri does relies on the cloud, but we do know that it’ll run for a couple hours straight, and then autonomously recharge itself on a floor dock.</p>
<figure>
<div class="readableLargeImageContainer">

</div>
</div><figcaption>Kuri is equipped with a camera, microphones, speakers, and touch sensors, and it also has a “laser-based sensor array” for obstacle detection, localization, and navigation.</figcaption><div class="readableLargeImageContainer">
<p>Besides mobility, what makes Kuri unique is the fact that it has no display (besides a color-changing light on its chest), and that it doesn’t even try to talk to you, as Pepper and Jibo do. There’s speech recognition, but Kuri won’t talk back, instead relying on a variety of beepy noises and its expressive head and eyes to communicate. Essentially, it’s R2-D2-ing, which is a verb now, meaning to have effective nonspeech interactions. I like this idea, because so much of what makes us frustrated with AI assistants is their inability to reliably respond like a human would. When something talks to you, you can’t help but expect it to communicate like a human, and when it inevitably fails, it’s annoying. Kuri sidesteps this by not giving you a chance to think that it’s trying to be human at all, theoretically making it much harder to disappoint.</p>
<p>You, like us, may have a few questions at this point. Questions like, “What does Kuri do?” Here’s everything the press materials say about that:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Kuri is built to connect with you and helps bring technology to life. Kuri can understand context and surroundings, recognize specific people, and respond to questions with facial expressions, head movements, and his unique lovable sounds. Like many adored robots in popular culture, his personality and ability to connect are his greatest attributes.</em></p></blockquote>

<div class="readableLargeImageContainer">
<p><img src="http://spectrum.ieee.org/image/Mjg0OTE4MQ.jpeg" alt="Kuri home robot is controlled by apps" width="1240" height="823" /></p>
</div>
</div><figcaption>An app lets users control Kuri and program the robot to perform different tasks.</figcaption>Or more specifically, in the context of Kuri’s hardware and software (which you interface with through an app):</p>
<ul>
<li>A built-in HD camera so you can check in on the house or pets while you’re away;</li>
<li>A four-microphone array, powerful dual speakers, and Wi-Fi + Bluetooth connectivity, so it can react to voice commands or noises, play music, read the kids a bedtime story, or follow you around playing podcasts while you’re getting ready for work;</li>
<li>Easily programmable tasks and IFTTT capabilities to connect within modern smart homes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these capabilities can be found in Amazon Echo or Google Home, and again, if you’re looking for that social component, Pepper and Jibo offer something comparable. What Kuri has going for it, from what we can tell, is simplicity to some extent and, even more important, mobility. We’re hoping that Mayfield will be able to tell us how its little robot will be uniquely valuable in ways that these other systems aren’t, and fortunately, we’re getting a chance to ask the company later today. We’ve got a meeting booked for this afternoon with CTO Kaijen Hsiao, and we should have time for both a demo and an interview. Let us know in the comments if there are any specific questions you’d like answers to.</p>
<p>If you’re already sold on Kuri, a US $100 deposit toward the $699 total cost will save you one for delivery in time for the holidays in 2017.</p>

<h4>As seen in Tom&#8217;s Guide, written by Avram Piltch</h4>
<div>
<p>Today, if you own a home robot, chances are it&#8217;s a soulless vacuum cleaner. But your next automaton could feel more like a relative than a robot. Available for pre-order today and shipping by Christmas 2017, Kuri is designed to socialize with and keep an eye on your family as it rolls around the house.</p>
<p>I had a chance to spend a few minutes with this $699 robot and was impressed with both its technical capabilities and its inviting design. The 20-inch tall, 14-pound device is about the size of a small child. It has a round white head with a bell-shaped white, gray and black torso that reminded me of friendly fictional robots such as Wall-E.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
<p>Social robots are the next big thing in computing. Later this year, Asus is expected to launch Zenbo, a social robot in a similar price range that provides a lot of the same features. The Kuri is at the leading edge of this wave. It could be as much a part of your family as a dog or a cat.</p>
<h2>Design and Communication</h2>
<p>The head tilts and the eyelids close, allowing Kuri to make a wide variety of expressions, from happiness to exasperation. There&#8217;s no mouth, nose or eyebrows, so the robot&#8217;s eyes and head position have to convey the message. Kuri has a speaker that can output any sound, but its own voice is a series of cute, disarming chirps.</p>
<div id="1483563825208">
<div class="readableLargeImageContainer"><img src="http://media.bestofmicro.com/D/N/642011/gallery/1483435562205_w_755.png" /></div>
</div>
<h2>Key Features and Use Cases</h2>
<p>Kuri has a 1080p camera, a speaker and a 4-microphone array that allows it to tell where a sound comes from. It also has a complex array of sensors in its belly that let it map your home and avoid obstacles.</p>
<p>In a brief demo, a Mayfield Robotics rep used a smartphone app to tell Kuri to go to the kitchen. Kuri immediately rolled over to the kitchen area, and on its way back, managed to avoid a suitcase we placed in its path.</p>
<p>Using the smartphone app, voice commands or IFTTT (If This, Then That), you can program Kuri to patrol your house, looking for anything out of the ordinary. It also has facial recognition and pet recognition, so it can tell if your dog is sitting on the couch and chirp at him to get down. Or it can see that your latchkey child arrived home and send you an alert. With IFTTT, you can use data from Kuri to control your smart home.</p>
<p>You can use Kuri as a telepresence robot, allowing you to view and talk to your family members when you&#8217;re not home. So, for example, if you want to see what your child is up to, you can roll Kuri over to her room and use the robot&#8217;s speaker to talk to him or her. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no screen on Kuri, so the person you&#8217;re talking to won&#8217;t be able to see your face as they can on most telepresence robots.</p>
<p>Kuri can also play games with your kids such as &#8220;follow the leader.&#8221; It has a built-in Bluetooth speaker so you can stream audio to it, allowing it to play an audio book or music. It can also act as an alarm and wake you up.</p>
<h2>Control</h2>
<p>Kuri wakes up when you pet its head, speak its name or use the included smartphone app. The robot supports voice recognition, but during our demo experience, the app provided the most functionality. Using the software, a Mayfield exec was able to directly control the robot, send it to a specific room, set it for patrol mode, set an alarm or issue emojis (facial expressions).</p>

<h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
<p>You can pre-order the $699 Kuri today with a deposit of $100 at <a href="http://heykuri.com/" rel="noopener">heykuri.com</a>. It will ship in time for Christmas 2017.</p>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>Kuri is a very cute robot with a lot of promise, but its success will depend on the different ways families make use of it. The telepresence and security camera features alone are impressive. However, most people will judge the robot based on its ability to have compelling and meaningful interactions with both adults and children.</p>
<p>The interactions I saw during the demo were mainly driven by the app, so it was hard for me to tell whether Kuri can really socialize with people on its own, or if it needs a lot of intervention by someone with a smartphone. Mayfield is still working on the software and has nearly a year to perfect it, so we&#8217;ll see how the product evolves over time.</p>

<article id="post-2140712">While robots have already infiltrated manufacturing and business — from self-driving cars to automated workplaces — it’s the consumer space that is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/growth-statistics-for-robots-market-2015-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ripe for these machines</a>. One area particularly suited is the home, and while we likely won’t see <a href="http://thejetsons.wikia.com/wiki/Rosie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosie the Robot Maid</a> from <em>The Jetsons</em> in the immediate future, companies  like <a href="http://www.mayfieldrobotics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mayfield Robotics</a> are working on making robots part of our residential lives.Today, the company introduced its first intelligent robot, called <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kur</a>i, which is billed as not only being aware and mobile, but also having a personality designed to brighten up your home. This $700 machine is available for preorder in the U.S. today, with a $100 deposit.</p>
<div class="readableLargeObjectContainer"></div>
<p>A combination butler and mobile hub for your connected device, Kuri is designed to blend in like a member of the family, and brings to mind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnv-iFhdlqE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall-E’s Eve</a>. Kuri comes equipped with a 1080p camera, a 4-microphone array, dual speakers, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and sensors that should prevent it from crashing into furniture or destroying property. You can program it to do certain tasks, and it supports IFTTT controls.</p>
<p>Kuri weighs approximately 14 pounds and is 20 inches tall.</p>
<p>“While insanely cute on the outside, Kuri contains serious technologies on the inside that represent the latest developments in smartphones, gaming, and robotics,” explained Mayfield Robotics chief technology officer and cofounder Kaijen Hsiao in a statement. “We hope Kuri introduces people — especially kids — to the power of technology and can inspire a new world of possibilities for their future.”</p>

<p>Targeted at “technically connected” professionals and equally savvy families, Kuri appears to be more than just a regular robot that activates when you need it. It can roam through your house nonchalantly, entertain your children, play music while following you around, read an audiobook out loud, turn off your lights, answer questions (such as “what’s the weather?”), and more. With its built-in camera, you can use it to monitor what’s going on in your home at all times.</p>
<p>While Kuri does have a battery, it comes with a charging dock, and you can instruct it to recharge by giving it audible commands. There is also an iOS and Android app for setup and control capabilities.</p>
<p>This is the first robot Mayfield Robotics has built for production, but it took a while to settle on the final design. According to company chief executive Mike Beebe, dozens of prototypes were created.  “We decided that we didn’t want to include a screen or a human voice. Instead Kuri speaks robot. His chirps and beeps were carefully designed to follow tonal cues from the English language,” Beebe told VentureBeat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We realized that if Kuri had a screen, and the screen showed anything other than eyes, Kuri would break character and become an object. Kuri’s chirps and beeps, combined with his physical eyes that express emotion, make him approachable and help to bring out his personality, so he’s not just another iPad on wheels.”</p>
<p>While there are numerous in-home robots currently on the market — such as the Asus Zenbo, SoftBank Pepper, Jibo, the Roomba vacuum, and the Amazon Echo — Beebe believes Kuri is in a category of its own:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Kuri is defining a new category for home robots; he falls in the middle of utility and entertainment. Kuri’s Bluetooth, wireless, autonomous, and recording capabilities give him the ability to perform several actions, and, on the other hand, Kuri’s personality, his adorable chirps, beeps, and expressions offer a sense of companionship and entertainment — things you can’t get from a utility-based robot. Kuri is built to connect with others, and in many ways, he is creating an entirely new category of robots.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Preorders for Kuri begin today with plans to begin shipping the robot in late 2017.</p>
