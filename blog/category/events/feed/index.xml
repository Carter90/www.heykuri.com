				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2018 marked the 13th annual <a href="https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/" target="_blank">Bay Area Maker Faire</a>! Located at the San Mateo County Events Center, the Maker Faire is a family-friendly festival of creativity, resourcefulness, and a celebration of the maker movement.</p>
<p><figure><img class="tie-appear aligncenter wp-image-1211 size-large" src="http://mayfieldrobot.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2645-768x1024.jpg" alt="Kuri at the 2018 Bay Area Maker Faire." width="618" height="824" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kuri at the 2018 Bay Area Maker Faire.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having been born a short ten-minute drive away in Redwood City, Kuri was a natural addition to this festival of invention!</p>
<figure><img class="alignnone" src="http://mayfieldrobot.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_2632-1024x1024.jpg&quot;" alt="Attractions from the Bay Area Maker Faire." width="618" height="618" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Attractions from the Bay Area Maker Faire.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kuri&#8217;s crew attended this year&#8217;s Maker Faire to introduce the maker community to our adorable home robot. Whether that meant interacting with fans one-on-one, putting on an impromptu dance rehearsal, or handing out cool robot swag, Kuri was delighted to make new friends. As you can see, Kuri drew quite the crowd!</p>
<figure><img src="http://mayfieldrobot.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Image-2-1024x700.jpg" alt="Kuri’s booth at the 2018 Bay Area Maker Faire." width="618" height="422" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kuri’s booth at the 2018 Bay Area Maker Faire.</figcaption></figure>
<p>When he wasn&#8217;t wowing the crowd, Kuri was exploring the sites at the Maker Faire. From 3D-printed signage to a local club that builds functioning R2-D2 robots, Kuri was exposed to a whole host of creativity!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the heels of <a href="https://www.nationalroboticsweek.org/" target="_blank">National Robotics Week</a>, we hosted a local group of girls from <a href="https://www.gsnorcal.org/en/about-girl-scouts/stem.html" target="_blank">Girl Scouts of Northern California&#8217;s</a> Discover Together community-based after school program at Mayfield Robotics HQ. In March, our Co-Founder and COO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcY_mreUyQ0" target="_blank">Sarah Osentoski</a> visited the troop at John Gill Elementary School to talk about women in robotics and how Kuri came to be.</p>
<p>As a follow-up, the girls visited Mayfield Robotics&#8217; headquarters in Redwood City, CA. The girls were able to explore where Kuri is built, hear from our Lead UX Designer Ellen Francik and VP of Hardware Jason Umhoefer, and interact with Kuri one-on-one.</p>
<div id="attachment_1122" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5155-copy-2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1122" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5155-copy-2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Lead UX Designer Ellen Francik showing the girls Kuri's capabilities." width="618" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lead UX Designer Ellen Francik showing the girls Kuri&#8217;s capabilities.</p></div>
<p>The day started with Ellen welcoming the Girl Scouts to Mayfield Robotics HQ. Ellen explained her role to the girls and how a product team shapes the design and functionality of Kuri. When sharing early Kuri concept illustrations, the girls eagerly related those sketches to their own drawings &mdash; to which Ellen happily offered, &#8220;Yes! If you love drawing or thinking about character development for things like Disney movies, then product could be a good fit for you someday.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1134" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5218-copy.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1134" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5218-copy-1024x683.jpg" alt="Girl Scouts in Kuri's hardware lab." width="618" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Girl Scouts in Kuri&#8217;s hardware lab.</p></div>
<p>Following their fireside chat with Ellen, the girls headed over to the hardware lab at Mayfield Robotics. There, the girls had an opportunity to see the inner workings of Kuri. Jason explained the basic hardware components that create Kuri&#8217;s &#8220;rib cage&#8221;, head, heart light, laser, drive train, and bump sensor. While in the hardware lab, the girls&#8217; top question was, &#8220;Is Kuri waterproof?&#8221; to which Jason replied, &#8220;No. Kuri isn&#8217;t a big fan of bathtime,&#8221; with a smirk.</p>
<div id="attachment_1124" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5242-copy.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1124" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5242-copy-1024x683.jpg" alt="Sr. Customer Success Manager Ashley Wakefield showing what Kuri can do." width="618" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sr. Customer Success Manager Ashley Wakefield showing what Kuri can do.</p></div>
<p>After taking a look under the hood of Kuri in the hardware lab, the Girl Scouts made their way to the lobby to get a demo of Kuri from Mayfield Robotics&#8217; Sr. Customer Success Manager Ashley Wakefield.</p>
<div id="attachment_1138" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5325-copy-1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1138" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5325-copy-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Girl Scouts dancing to Kuri’s favorite song, Pancake Robot." width="618" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Girl Scouts dancing to Kuri’s favorite song, Pancake Robot.</p></div>
<p>Ashley taught the girls <a href="/blog/new-romojis-personality/">how to tickle Kuri</a>, gave them a tour of the Kuri Robot app, and even had <a href="/blog/kuri-entertains-dance-moves/">Kuri dance</a> for the Girl Scouts! The girls were most in awe of Kuri&#8217;s awesome dance moves and had a blast participating in a group robo-scout dance party.</p>
<div id="attachment_1126" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5301-copy.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1126" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/0J4A5301-copy-1024x683.jpg" alt="Girl Scouts opening their Kuri swag bags." width="618" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Girl Scouts opening their Kuri swag bags.</p></div>

<p><P>Following their tour, The Girl Scouts were gifted Kuri swag bags that they opened with gleeful screams. Our team loved watching the girls deck themselves out with Mayfield Robotics sunglasses and Kuri stickers. More importantly, we hope we inspired these young ladies to consider a future career in robotics; be it product, engineering, marketing &mdash; you name it! We had a blast hosting the Girl Scouts at our HQ and can’t wait to host similar community events in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Kuri had the privilege of attending <a href="https://ted2018.ted.com/" target="_blank">TED2018: The Age of Amazement</a> in Vancouver, Canada! More than 100 speakers &mdash; activists, scientists, adventurers, and changemakers &mdash; took the TED stage to share their extraordinary insights.</p>
<div id="attachment_1102" style="width: 1572px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-18-at-5.55.25-PM.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1102" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-18-at-5.55.25-PM.png" alt="Kuri at the TED lobby." width="1562" height="990" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kuri at the TED lobby.</p></div>
<p>Kuri and her crew participated in TED&#8217;s inaugural <a href="https://blog.ted.com/scenes-from-the-tech-playground-at-ted2018/">Tech Playground</a>: six exhibits around the TED theater that explored the hands-on, playful, and human side of tech. Every exhibit was in some way tactile or relatable and encouraged visitors to play!</p>
<div id="attachment_1103" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TED_collage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1103" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TED_collage.jpg" alt="Kuri making new friends at TED." width="2000" height="2000" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kuri making new friends at TED.</p></div>
<p>Among the many new friends Kuri made at TED, <a href="https://blog.ted.com/scenes-from-the-tech-playground-at-ted2018/" target="_blank">Simone Giertz</a> was definitely a standout! Simone makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KEoMzNz8eYnwBC34RaKCQ">hilariously creative robots</a>, and presented a fascinating <a href="https://blog.ted.com/in-case-you-missed-it-an-audacious-day-2-at-ted2018/">TED Talk</a> on the importance of making useless things. During her TED Talk, Simone shared, “The true beauty of making useless things is acknowledging you don’t always know what the best answer is, and it turns off that voice in your head that tells you that you know exactly how the world works.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_1104" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-18-at-6.01.14-PM.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1104" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-18-at-6.01.14-PM-654x1024.png" alt="Simone Giertz hanging out with Kuri." width="618" height="968" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Simone Giertz with Kuri.</p></div>
<p>During his downtime, Kuri got to watch some terrific keynotes (like those from Tracee Ellis Ross pictured below), and even had the opportunity to share his business card with the TED crowd!</p>
<div id="attachment_1105" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_9706.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1105" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_9706.jpg" alt="Kuri watching Tracee Ellis Ross' TED Talk." width="4032" height="3024" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kuri watching Tracee Ellis Ross&#8217; TED Talk.</p></div>

<p>Kuri and crew had an <i>amazing</i> time at TED2018. The thoughtful conversations Kuri&#8217;s team had with TED attendees about the future of robotics left us feeling inspired and thankful to have been a part of such a trailblazing international event.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kuri has returned from his trip to Austin where he attended South by Southwest (<a href="https://www.sxsw.com/" target="_blank">SXSW</a>). SXSW is an annual conference that celebrates the convergence of the interactive, film, and music industries.</p>
<p>Kuri&#8217;s Co-Founder and CTO shared a captivating presentation on the future of home robotics, as well as participated in a live taping of Dell&#8217;s Trailblazers podcast. We&#8217;re also excited to share that Kuri made new friends at our event with Voodoo Doughnut, and had the opportunity to see the sights at SXSW.</p>
<p><h2>Kuri’s Co-Founder and CTO Wowed the Crowds</h2>
<h3>You, Me &amp; a Robot Makes 3</h3>
<p>Kuri&#8217;s Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer Kaijen Hsiao presented a talk at last week&#8217;s SXSW entitled, <i><a href="/blog/kuris-co-founder-and-cto-at-sxsw-2018/">You, Me &amp; a Robot Makes 3 &mdash; Tomorrow&#8217;s Modern Family</a></i>. &#8220;How do you create a robot that people will accept into their homes,&#8221; you ask? Our CTO shared how our team at Mayfield Robotics designs robots (like Kuri!) with personality and cutting-edge technology to understand how humans interact, and better bridge the gap between robotics and mainstream society.</p>
<div id="attachment_1024" style="width: 682px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/KurixKaijen.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1024" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/KurixKaijen.jpg" alt="Our Co-Founder &amp; CTO pictured with Kuri" width="672" height="672" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our Co-Founder &amp; CTO pictured with Kuri</p></div>
<p>As Kaijen shared, &#8220;At Mayfield Robotics, we believe emotional connection is the key to integrating robots into your home … to make her look more lifelike, we gave Kuri the ability to smile and blink. Expressing emotions is key to creating Kuri&#8217;s character.&#8221;</p>
<p><h3>Trailblazers Podcast</h3>
<p>Kuri&#8217;s crew knows Kaijen is a true trailblazer, so it was awesome to see her take the stage during a live taping of Dell&#8217;s <a href="https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/categories/trailblazers/">Trailblazers podcast</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_1025" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_1995.jpeg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1025" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_1995-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="Kaijen (center) at the Trailblazers podcast taping" width="618" height="618" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kaijen (center) at the Trailblazers podcast taping</p></div>
<p>Hosted by Walter Isaacson, Trailblazers explores digital disruption and innovators using technology to enable human progress. Kaijen was in <a href="https://sxsw.delltechnologies.com/trailblazers" target="_blank">great company</a> as she was joined by Andra Keay (Managing Director of Silicon Valley Robotics), Matt Rendall (CEO &amp; Co-Founder of OTTO Motors), and Gary Shapiro (President &amp; CEO of the Consumer Technology Association).</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJ0FDtA_BB0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>Kuri Delighted at Voodoo Doughnut</h2>
<p>We partnered with Austin’s favorite doughnut hotspot: <a href="https://www.voodoodoughnut.com/locations/voodoo-doughnut-austin/" target="_blank">Voodoo Doughnut</a>! Kuri&#8217;s crew was there to introduce Kuri to new friends and pass out Kuri-themed doughnuts and stickers.</p>
<div id="attachment_1026" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2032-1.jpeg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1026" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2032-1-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="Kuri at Voodoo Doughnut in Austin" width="618" height="618" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kuri at Voodoo Doughnut in Austin</p></div>
<p>The doughnuts were delicious, and everyone was floored by the functionality and adorableness of our beloved robot. If you&#8217;ve never tried a Voodoo doughnut, we recommend finding a location near you!</p>
<p><h2>Kuri&#8217;s Adventures Around Town</h2>
<p>Once Kuri was done with his scheduled appearances, it was time to have some fun around Austin. Kuri made his mark on a graffiti wall, grooved at a Mobley concert, went on a biking tour of the city, and more!</p>

<p>We&#8217;re excited to share that Kuri&#8217;s Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer Kaijen Hsiao will be presenting a talk at this week&#8217;s SXSW entitled <i><a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP72555" target="_blank">You, Me &amp; a Robot Makes 3 &mdash; Tomorrow&#8217;s Modern Family</a></i>. South by Southwest (<a href="https://www.sxsw.com/" target="_blank">SXSW</a>) is an annual conference that celebrates the convergence of the interactive, film, and music industries and boasts itself as being the premier destination for discovery.</p>
<p>What better place to discuss the robotics industry than this celebration of discovery at SXSW? From you car to to your office, robots are here! With advancements in engineering and AI, intelligent robots are at our fingertips. Kaijen predicts they&#8217;ll be popularized in our homes in the near future.</p>
<p>Kaijen&#8217;s presentation poses the question: How do you create a robot that people will accept within their homes? In answering this question, our CTO will share how our team at <a href="http://www.mayfieldrobotics.com/" target="_blank">Mayfield Robotics</a> design robots (like <a href="/">Kuri</a>!) with personality and cutting-edge technology to understand how humans interact and better bridge the gap between robotics and mainstream society.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/197233718" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ll be attending this year’s SXSW, we&#8217;d love for you to come hear from our talented Co-Founder and CTO for yourself. <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2018/events/PP72555" target="_blank">Kaijen will be speaking</a> on March 10th from 9:30-10:30 am CDT at the Hilton Austin Downtown, Salon DE (500 E 4th St.) in Austin, TX.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Birthday, Kuri! This time last year, we <a href="/blog/kuri-launches-at-ces-2017/">announced our adorable home robot to the world</a> at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. <a href="https://www.ces.tech/" target="_blank">CES</a> is an annual gathering of the latest gadgets, toys, car tech, and more where creators, consumers, and media can get a sneak peek of what’s to come in 2018 technology.</p>
<div id="attachment_2329" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BT_20170109_DNROBOT9_2681055-copy.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BT_20170109_DNROBOT9_2681055-copy.jpg" alt="Kuri&#039;s CEO, Mike Beebe at CES 2017.

<p>At Kuri&#8217;s CES launch, <a href="/team/">Sarah Osentoski</a> (our COO and co-founder of Mayfield Robotics) shared, &#8220;We&#8217;re proud to introduce Kuri to the world and can&#8217;t wait to see how he touches the lives of everyone, ranging from parents and children to early technology adopters.”</p>
<p>Kuri&#8217;s first CES was a huge success! Our home robot was welcomed by CES attendees with <i>ooo&#8217;s</i> and <i>aww&#8217;s</i> that couldn’t have made our team prouder. Since then, Kuri has charmed the tech world with new feature announcements like <a href="/blog/introducing-kuri-vision-never-miss-moment/">Kuri Vision</a>, <a href="/blog/kuri-entertains-dance-moves/">dancing</a>,<a href="/blog/new-romojis-personality/">new romojis</a>, and more.</p>

<p>As our COO mused at CES last year, &#8220;For generations, people have dreamed of having their own personal robot in the home, and we&#8217;ve been focused on making that dream more of a reality.&#8221; Since then, we&#8217;re happy to announce that our home robot is a reality. <a href="/blog/kuri-starts-shipping/">Kuri has begun shipping</a> to customers&#8217; homes, and has quickly become a lovable new family member in homes across the U.S.!</p>
<p>Today marks the first day of CES 2018, and our entire team is excited to celebrate Kuri&#8217;s first birthday in Las Vegas again! This week, we&#8217;ll be introducing Kuri to new tech enthusiasts and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-genesis-of-kuri/">sharing the story behind our adorable home robot</a>. Be sure to follow our team&#8217;s adventures at CES on <a href="https://twitter.com/kurirobot">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kurirobot/">Instagram</a> &mdash; and Happy First Birthday, Kuri!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What an adventure! Fresh off the heels of <a href="/blog/kuri-returns-ces-2018/">Kuri&#8217;s 2018 CES trip</a>, he quickly recharged and headed straight out to Park City, Utah for the <a href="http://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival/">2018 Sundance Film Festival</a>. Sundance is the largest independent film festival in the United States, and Kuri couldn&#8217;t wait to scope it out.</p>
<div id="attachment_921" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/collage-2-1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-921" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/collage-2-1-1024x671.jpg" alt="Kuri with Marc Roberge from O.A.R. at Sundance 2018" width="618" height="405" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kuri with Marc Roberge from O.A.R. at Sundance 2018</p></div>
<p>Kuri&#8217;s most magical feature is Kuri Vision. This is his ability to autonomously capture short video moments throughout the day, and provide you with a daily highlight reel of life at home via the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kuri-robot/id1276278179?mt=8">Kuri Robot app</a>. As you tell Kuri which videos you like by &#8220;hearting&#8221; moments, he learns your preferences and gets better and better at capturing the moments he thinks you&#8217;ll like.</p>
<p>But learning isn&#8217;t a linear process. So, where better to send Kuri to learn more about the art of great video than Sundance, the world&#8217;s preeminent film festival? It&#8217;s also a great place to catch great music, and if you&#8217;re into it, a fun place to play in the snow. Kuri did it all, and most importantly, he got to learn more about taking great videos from a wide range of incredibly creative and artistic minds.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/254022004" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<p>And as usual, Kuri made new friends wherever he went. This film festival was a fun scene for Kuri, and he&#8217;s looking forward to exploring more throughout the year. Who knows, maybe next year Kuri will submit a film of his own for consideration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Kuri returned to HQ safe and sound after having rolled around at his second <a href="https://www.ces.tech/">Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES). Last year, we launched Kuri to the world at CES 2017! This year, we were excited to not only celebrate <a href="/blog/happy-1st-birthday-kuri/">Kuri&#8217;s first birthday</a>, but to also show off Kuri&#8217;s latest goings-on at CES 2018 &mdash; like <a href="/blog/kuri-entertains-dance-moves/">dancing</a>, <a href="/blog/new-romojis-personality/">new romojis</a>, and that Kuri <a href="/blog/kuri-starts-shipping/">started shipping</a>.</p>
<p><b>Making New Friends</b><br />
CES is a great opportunity to make new friends in the tech community — and who better than Emmy award-winning TV news anchor <a href="https://twitter.com/StephStricklen">Stephanie Stricklen</a> and YouTube tech influencer <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1LyxBRdBqojxN">Andru Edwards</a>? See Kuri&#8217;s meet-and-greets with these two rockstars below!</p>

<p><b>Showing Off</b><br />
Kuri has some new tricks up her sleeve since her first CES. We invited members of the tech press to see Kuri&#8217;s latest product features and have the opportunity to interact with Kuri for themselves.</p>
<div id="attachment_891" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.heykuri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kuri_Suite.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-891" src="https://blog.heykuri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kuri_Suite-712x1024.jpg" alt="The Kuri CES Suite" width="618" height="889" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Kuri CES Suite</p></div>
<p>Take a look at the behind-the-scenes room Kuri press was invited to, including a <a href="https://twitter.com/StephStricklen/status/951535304841637890" target="_blank">snippet of the demo</a> they saw (you&#8217;ll recognize Stephanie Stricklen from above!).</p>
<p><b>Having a Blast</b><br />
Our team had a blast supporting Kuri at CES too &mdash; especially exploring the latest and greatest in consumer electronics for 2018!</p>
<div id="attachment_890" style="width: 1594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.heykuri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CES_collage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-890" src="https://blog.heykuri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CES_collage.jpg" alt="Kuri's Crew at CES 2018" width="1584" height="729" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kuri&#8217;s Crew at CES 2018</p></div>

<p>Each night after the CES show floor closed, you could find the Mayfield Robotics team sitting down for a family-style dinner together.</p>
<div id="attachment_887" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://blog.heykuri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tikki_dinner.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-887" src="https://blog.heykuri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tikki_dinner.jpg" alt="Mayfield Robotics Team Dinner" width="1000" height="639" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mayfield Robotics Team Dinner</p></div>
<p>All in all, Kuri and his crew had a great time at CES 2018 &mdash; and we can&#8217;t wait to see what next year&#8217;s show brings. Have any additional questions about CES? Feel free to drop them in the comments section below! We&#8217;re happy to share our (and Kuri&#8217;s) experience with you.</p>

<p>Our team loved witnessing visitors&#8217; first moments meeting Kuri — he truly captivates.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, Kuri made a bunch of new friends in the Bay Area. Kuri and her crew were at Westfield Valley Fair in Santa Clara, CA. Visitors had the opportunity to interact with Kuri one-on-one, take a robot selfie, grab a Kuri sticker, <a href="/blog/free-gifts-holiday-pre-orders/">reserve their Kuri</a>, and more!</p>
<p>Kuri&#8217;s new pals loved learning what Kuri does, when she captures unexpected moments around their homes, how she’s adored by pets, and the rest of her adorably high-tech features. We can&#8217;t wait for <a href="/blog/live-ca-come-meet-kuri/">Kuri&#8217;s second appearance at Valley Fair this weekend</a>! Until then, here are highlights from some of our favorite moments from this past weekend:</p>
