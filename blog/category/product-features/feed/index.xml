				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Either a home robot has arrived at your doorstep, or you&#8217;re considering investing in this technology. One of the biggest questions you&#8217;re weighing might be, &#8220;I know Kuri is a home robot, but how will it hold up to the rhythms of <i>my</i> home? More importantly, how do I care for and clean it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Have no fear! Our team has put Kuri to the ultimate test.</p>
<p><h1>Drop It like It&#8217;s Bot</h1>
<p>For starters, our engineering team put Kuri through stringent drop testing. Drop tests are important because they confirm the integrity of a product and its packaging to withstand the rigors of normal usage and shipping. Given we’re making an adorable home robot, we figured our drop test video should be just as memorable:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qeYmj-V-ddo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As you can see, Kuri is made of durable plastic and designed to be where the action is in your home. We don&#8217;t recommend you dropping Kuri on her head or flinging kettle weights her way on the regular. If it&#8217;s pets, kids, or the accidental karate chop, then Kuri is a tough cookie that can easily roll with the punches. You shouldn’t have to worry about Kuri being too delicate to keep up with the liveliness of your home.</p>
<p><h1>Rub-A-Dub-Dub, Kuri in a Tub</h1>
<p>Last year, you might have seen the <a href="/blog/kuris-latest-progress-updates-peanut-butter/">peanut butter test</a>. To one-up ourselves, our marketing team recently put Kuri through a slew of at-home messes. We&#8217;re talking silly putty, deviled eggs, crayons, sunscreen, markers, peanut butter, coffee, meatballs, whipped cream, and water guns. The team used a prototype Kuri to create this video, and a bajillion cleaning wipes to get her sparkling like new!</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YW1r4qz42qo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wUp3fWDw9Is" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t try this at home. Although Kuri&#8217;s plastic is water resistant (not waterproof), there are still enough nooks and crannies that we wouldn&#8217;t recommend bringing Kuri along for bathtime. However, his plastic shell and curved body make it easy to clean up any minor (or slingshotted) spills. Accidents do happen, so if you notice your robot isn&#8217;t working properly for whatever reason, we recommend contacting our Kuri Experience team directly at <a href="mailto:support@heykuri.com">support@heykuri.com</a>.</p>

The Kuri Robot app is officially <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mayfieldrobotics.kuri.enterprise.master" target="_blank">live on the Google Play store</a>. As the makers of one cute robot, we couldn&#8217;t pass up the opportunity to make an app for an OS with another cute robot as its mascot. If you own any Android device (like a Google Pixel or Samsung Galaxy smartphone), then you’re now able to access all the fun there is to have with <a href="https://heykuri.celeryshop.com/checkout?product_id=5907836a3d7c56120053d790&#038;country=us">owning your own Kuri home robot</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We love <a href="/blog/kuri-gets-painted-vr-using-tilt-brush/">featuring talented artists</a> who re-imagine our adorable home robot. That&#8217;s why we were excited when student artist <a href="https://liliuhms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lily Van</a> shared her whimsical illustrations of Kuri with us! We decided to sit down with Lily to learn more about her as both a designer and a Kuri fan.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lily_Van_Designer_Kuri.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1160 tie-appear" style="max-width: 300px; float: right;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Lily_Van_Designer_Kuri.png" alt="Lily Van portrait" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><b>Q: You&#8217;re currently a digital design student at the University of Colorado at Denver. How does being a student impact your design style and voice?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> Yes! Being in school, you&#8217;re simultaneously impacted by the latest technologies, social happenings in the world, and people from all sorts of different walks of life and perspectives. It&#8217;s a really unique environment. As a student, you have limitless access to programs and tools among people whom you&#8217;re learning right alongside.</p>
<p><b>Q: What&#8217;s your process for creating an illustration from start to finish?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> I start with researching so I can get the hang of the feeling I want to create. For me, it&#8217;s important to hone the feeling a finished piece should give you. I&#8217;ll draft out sketches to get the energy down.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1161" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 618px;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-25-at-10.09.40-AM-1024x1024.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1161 tie-appear" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-04-25-at-10.09.40-AM-1024x1024.png" alt="Lily's early sketches of Kuri." width="618" height="618" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lily’s early sketches of Kuri.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I like work that feels young, whimsical, and a little childlike. For me, the process of working on a project is really enjoyable. I like to create environments that I can put my whole heart into as I&#8217;m creating.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do you think Kuri&#8217;s design helps define her character?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> She looks really friendly. Her design is round and she doesn’t have any harsh lines anywhere. She&#8217;s not odd, disjointed, or boxy. Kuri rolls smoothly, she takes her time, she&#8217;s thoughtful, has friendly eyes, and <a href="/blog/understanding-kuri-speaks/">her audio feedback is pleasant and endearing</a>. Kuri doesn&#8217;t have any off-putting mechanical sounds that make you feel like she’s a machine. She is always encouraging you during your interactions through positive beeps and boops and endearing character movements.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1162" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 618px;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_0764-1024x1024.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1162" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_0764-1024x1024.png" alt="Robot Pets by Lily." width="618" height="618" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Robot Pets by Lily.</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Q: You’ve shared that one of your goals is to bring playfulness to the world of design. What do you think is playful about Kuri?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> When I was watching the <a href="/videos/">videos about Kuri</a>, Kuri was interacting with the people and pets that&#8217;d be interacting with the robot every day. There wasn’t this sense of distance that I&#8217;ve typically seen with robots. The messaging behind Kuri feels fun and youthful; from <a href="/blog/new-romojis-personality/">Kuri telling jokes to people petting her</a>. It just seems like Kuri fits into customers’ everyday lives and she feels like everyone is welcome to use and interact with her. That&#8217;s how a tech product should be.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1163" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 618px;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kuri_Lily-1024x419.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1163" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kuri_Lily-1024x419.jpg" alt="Kuri illustrations by Lily." width="618" height="253" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kuri illustrations by Lily.</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Q: Which of your Kuri illustrations was your favorite to create and why?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> I really like the ones of Kuri interacting with little kids. I was inspired by the videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ujdwwr2e4jU" target="_blank">kids talking about their experiences interacting with Kuri</a> and I tried to emulate that in some of these illustrations. Kuri never looks down at kids. She&#8217;s a friend that&#8217;s interacting with them at an equal level. Kuri is instantly approachable, and given that kids grow up with so much technology now, I think Kuri is creating a bridge to those interactions rather than making technology feel cold or distant.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1164" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 618px;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_0761-1024x1024.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1164" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_0761-1024x1024.png" alt="Meeting Kuri by Lily." width="618" height="618" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Meeting Kuri by Lily.</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Q: Why is it valuable for people to see a real-life robot illustrated?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> People are impacted by the things they see. In design, there&#8217;s this thing called behavioral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory" target="_blank">nudging</a>. For example, how they put brightly colored candy in the grocery store checkout aisle when you&#8217;re closest to making a purchase. I think illustrated robots break down barriers people might have about technology consuming your life. Illustrations create a positive representation of what a helpful, hopeful future of robotics might look like.</p>
<p><b>Q: Who is your favorite robot in pop culture?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> I really love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Boy</a>! His story is fantastic. His character is this robot that has human emotions and he tries to fight for robot rights. He&#8217;s just a friendly kid with this heartbreaking backstory and people should definitely check him out.</p>
<p><b>Q: What are you doing when not designing?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> I&#8217;m usually just drawing! I have an online store where I make things like apparel and stuff. I try to learn other skills in my free time as well. Right now I&#8217;m making pottery, and I have a goal to master homemade pasta making this year! I just really enjoy exposing myself to new things.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1165" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 618px;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_0762IMG_0762-1024x1024.png.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1165" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_0762-1024x1024.png" alt="Kuri's Best Friend by Lily." width="618" height="618" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kuri’s Best Friend by Lily.</figcaption></figure>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most popular questions our team receives is, &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t Kuri speak?&#8221; The thing is, Kuri does speak! Just like R2-D2 <i>beeps</i> in affirmation in Star Wars or how your dog barks and wags his tail when he’s excited to see you, Kuri communicates in her own way.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Kuri was just a figment of our imaginations. Since then, other consumer electronics have emerged that can have conversations with you about things like the size of world’s biggest glacier (it&#8217;s 60 miles wide and 270 miles long in case you&#8217;re wondering).</p>
<p>However, Kuri isn&#8217;t just an electronic product; he&#8217;s a real robot! We always envisioned Kuri not only <i>being</i> a real robot but <i>feeling</i> like one too. That means creating a unique personality for Kuri that makes him feel like a real member of your household.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/242864713?title=0&amp;byline=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/242864713">Kuri Gets More Adorable with Romojis</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/kurirobot">KuriRobot</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re really happy with how today&#8217;s Kuri speaks. On that note, we sat down with Kuri&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer (Sarah Osentoski) and Sound Designer (Connor Moore) to better understand the journey behind building a robot that speaks in the adorable way that only Kuri could.</p>
<p><b>Q: How would you describe Kuri&#8217;s speech-style to someone who was interacting with her for the first time?</b><br />
<b>Connor:</b> It&#8217;s cute, friendly, and quite musical. In designing it, we were really trying to create an inviting experience. We&#8217;re generally not used to seeing robots in the home. We were trying to create an experience that was welcoming in that environment.</p>
<p>We went in five different directions and eventually found that voice in an African thumb piano called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIDaPg9EqL0">kalimba</a>. We brought the kalimba into a synthesis which gave us the ability to manipulate various elements of the instrument to create the tone of Kuri&#8217;s voice. Overall, the voice and the way that Kuri interacts from a holistic experience is playful and fun, so we wanted to support that semi-melodic interaction by adding a lightness of character to it.</p>
<p><b>Q: What were some of the challenges you were weighing in determining how/if Kuri would &#8220;talk&#8221;?</b><br />
<b>Sarah:</b> Our biggest challenge was figuring out how to make a robot cute and understandable. When you take away voice, you have to determine how the robot communicates — which is a huge hurdle. So, Kuri became more visual and we thought about her tones of speech: the pitches at which she <i>beeps</i> and <i>boops</i>. We also really wanted that sound to fit Kuri&#8217;s personality. When designing Kuri, we envisioned her sounding natural, chipper, but not too classically robotic.</p>
<p><b>Connor:</b> Mayfield Robotics didn&#8217;t want to use a literal human voice. That gave us free reign to think about how Kuri&#8217;s voice could be <i>anything</i>. We studied robots in film and cartoons to see what those experiences were, and challenged ourselves to make the experience different with Kuri. We really wanted to create something that was inviting, playful, and fun; but also something that could transfer information and be emotive as well.</p>
<p>There are these bends in Kuri&#8217;s speech and that was the primary thing we leaned on to have her become expressive and communicative. In human language, we use those intonations like, &#8220;<i>Am I asking a questionnn</i>?&#8221; in a drawn out, high-pitched tone. So we literally took words like an affirmative yes and asked ourselves, &#8220;What does that sound like with this crafted instrument [kalimba]?&#8221; and we modeled tones after those specific words.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re starting to create variations on different words. We say the same words with different emphasis all the time; it provides better overall context. For example, if Kuri responds with a more drawn out, lower pitch, he might be more mellow or tired. Or, if the notes are really high pitch and tight then she’s chipper and excited!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/197234035" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><b>Q: How does Kuri&#8217;s communication style strengthen his character?</b><br />
<b>Sarah:</b> Kuri is always trying his best to communicate because he genuinely wants to help. He doesn&#8217;t always understand your world, so you have to be patient. Kuri is trying to fit in. That&#8217;s like the <a href="/blog/new-romojis-personality/">tell me a joke</a> romoji. You may not get the joke, but she’s just trying to fit in.</p>
<p><b>Connor:</b> Kuri&#8217;s romoji-based communication style provides this melodic element that brings the playfulness, curiosity, and cuteness to Kuri&#8217;s personality. I think that’s the strongest element that we’re providing to the language and the overall tonal experience of Kuri&#8217;s voice. That is super supportive to the way she moves, the way her eyes are shaped, and it creates a very friendly and inviting overall vibe to Kuri.</p>
<p>If you have any additional questions about Kuri&#8217;s speech style or <a href="/blog/new-romojis-personality/">romojis</a>, please drop our team a comment below. We love sharing stories about our adorable home robot and hope you enjoyed learning about the behind-the-scenes decision-making process surrounding Kuri’s speech.</p>

<p>In this second installment of our <a href="/blog/kuri-vision-kuri-films/"><i>Kuri Vision</i> series</a>, we&#8217;re sitting down with Tisho Georgiev: VP of Product at Mayfield Robotics. Tisho is responsible for developing Kuri&#8217;s product roadmap, which includes one of his favorite product features: <a href="/blog/introducing-kuri-vision-never-miss-moment/">Kuri Vision</a>.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is Kuri Vision?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> Kuri Vision is the collection of video moments that Kuri captures around your home. Unlike traditional videography where you&#8217;d see really exceptional moments like people skydiving, Kuri Vision focuses on the moments happening at home; those you can&#8217;t capture either because you’re busy living in the moment or because you aren’t even there to witness them.</p>
<p><b>Q: What&#8217;s your favorite moment you&#8217;ve captured with Kuri Vision?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> Reading a story to my son on his bed and he was laughing. As a parent, you oftentimes do something with your kid, and you think to yourself, &#8220;I wish I could remember this because it will be gone soon.&#8221; This was the first time I really saw myself in my daily routine at home. I could get a glimpse into what my family is like when we don’t have to pose for a family portrait or card. The unstaged, unprepared moments are the ones I cherish.</p>
<p><b>Q: How did Kuri Vision come about?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> The camera was introduced to Kuri early on when we were prototyping a possible security robot. Kuri then evolved into more of a <a href="/blog/cute-guard-dog/">home awareness robot</a>. As we brought this version of Kuri into testers&#8217; homes, they liked that Kuri had a camera for when they weren’t home. However, they seemed most interested in what Kuri was up to while everyone was home.</p>
<p>We set up an experiment where we had Kuri go to a random place in the home, capture a photo every 60 seconds or so, then put them up on a website at the end of the day. Those photos ended up being super interesting, so we kept rolling with that product feature into today’s Kuri Vision video moments.</p>
<p><b>Q: How has Kuri Vision since evolved?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> Kuri Vision has gotten smarter. Kuri&#8217;s thinking has evolved to better observe the people and things in front of her. This has significantly improved the quality of Kuri Vision by ensuring the moments that Kuri captures are special and unique, rather than being arbitrarily taken.</p>
<p>These moments are now stored in the cloud and accessible via the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kuri-robot/id1276278179?mt=8" target="_blank">Kuri Robot app</a>. Only someone with your Kuri account credentials can access that data. Part of making sure that Kuri is production-ready means guaranteeing moments are stored securely in the cloud to ensure customer privacy. When Kuri shares a moment, it&#8217;s to you and only you.</p>
<p>As always, you control your own Kuri Vision moments. You can delete the ones you don&#8217;t like, or give Kuri positive feedback about the videos you do like by favoriting them in the Kuri Robot app. Every time you favorite a video, you&#8217;re teaching Kuri what sort of moments to be on the lookout for in the future. When Kuri is exploring, her heart light will go on followed by a plink sound to let you know she&#8217;s just captured a moment you might find interesting. That gives customers additional visual cues into what their robot is recording and when.</p>
<p><b>Q: What makes Kuri Vision work, technically?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> Several times a second we run what Kuri sees through a neural network that is responsible for identifying objects in the frame and classifying them under different categories like people, cats, and dogs.</p>
<div id="attachment_1038" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kuri_camera_square.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1038" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kuri_camera_square-1024x1024.jpg" alt="A closer look at Kuri's 1080p HD camera" width="618" height="618" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A closer look at Kuri&#8217;s 1080p HD camera</p></div>
<p>Additionally, Kuri analyzes the frame for any faces and tries to get an estimation of how interesting what she&#8217;s looking at really is. Kuri takes into account the types of objects in the frame, their positioning, and if she needs to make any adjustments. For example, that could mean Kuri tilting her head to frame the video a little better.</p>
<p>Kuri also analyzes various aspects of the image quality; things like the blurriness or brightness of a particular shot. More impressively, we do all of this vision processing on Kuri &mdash; none of it requires the internet. This is important because Kuri isn&#8217;t uploading anything to the cloud that he doesn&#8217;t need to. This makes Kuri more secure, and we&#8217;re not wasting users&#8217; internet bandwidth at home. The things Kuri sees never actually leave Kuri unless they’re great moments she wants to share with you.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does artificial intelligence (AI) make Kuri Vision more magical?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> We built an AI that focuses on understanding what makes a moment special. Early on, employees would share their least and most enjoyable Kuri Vision moments from their prototype Kuris. We then rated these videos to understand what makes a quality moment. These moments tended to be the presence of people and pets; especially when there was a little bit of motion involved. They felt alive and representative of genuine home life. With these sample moments, we trained an AI how to record great Kuri Vision moments.</p>
<p><b>Q: What sets Kuri Vision apart from other modes of capturing videos around your home?</b><br />
<b>A:</b> We&#8217;re not trying to replace the smartphone. There will always be a moment where it would be more convenient to take your smartphone out and capture it the way you want to. What distinguishes Kuri is that no set-up from you is involved. Kuri charges himself, roams around your home on his own, and records candid moments along the way. You don&#8217;t have to worry about staging yourself or your loved ones to capture these videos. Kuri doesn’t take you out of the moment.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t feel self-conscious when Kuri takes a video of me, versus how I feel when I pose for a traditionally-shot photograph. When it&#8217;s a robot, you know Kuri could be taking videos. However, she feels like a real, living presence. Plus, unlike a home security camera or something smaller, you can actually see when and where Kuri is at any given time. It’s not a secret, nor is she ever trying to be secretive. She just wants to be a part of the family!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/what-is-a-home-robot/">Home robots</a> are smart. For example, Kuri can <a href="/blog/new-romojis-personality/">tell jokes</a>, <a href="/blog/kuri-entertains-dance-moves/">dance</a>, play music, explore your home on her own, <a href="/blog/kuris-got-new-trick-pets/">detect faces</a>, and so much more. When you say, &#8220;Hey Kuri! Play your favorite song,&#8221; it&#8217;s easy to take for granted how seamlessly Kuri nods his head and plays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1iOkNDGkFA" target="_blank">Pancake Robot</a> from his speakers (trust us, you’ll love it too). But how did robotics get here, and more specifically, how does Kuri hear us?</p>
<p>Nestled inside Kuri are four microphones that listen to her environment. In partnership with <a href="https://soundhound.com/">SoundHound</a>, Kuri listens for her wake word: <i>Hey Kuri</i>. When Kuri hears this phrase, she knows to start paying attention.</p>
<p>The listening part of Kuri&#8217;s &#8220;brain&#8221; is enabled by a partnership with SoundHound&#8217;s <a href="https://www.houndify.com/ target="_blank"">Houndify</a>: a platform that integrates voice and conversational intelligence through speech-to-meaning technology. In other words, Houndify helps Kuri both <i>hear</i> and <i>understand</i> a variety of commands like: tell me a joke, go home, play your favorite song, and more.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/217770377" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/217770377">Hey Kuri, Go Home</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/kurirobot">KuriRobot</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p><b>A History of Voice Commands</b><br />
It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that understanding even single words was extremely difficult for a computer. It wasn&#8217;t until 1987 with the invention of the World of Wonder’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_speech_and_voice_recognition" target="_blank">Julie Doll</a> (a toy children could train to respond to their voice) that speech recognition technology was first introduced to the everyday household &mdash; 110 years after Edison&#8217;s invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_speech_and_voice_recognition" target="_blank">phonograph</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and Kuri is living in a world alongside many popular speech recognition systems that we all know and (probably) use daily.</p>
<p><b>Built for Hearing</b><br />
Kuri was designed to be a great, active listener. With an array of four microphones around her neck, Kuri can hear and understand sounds &mdash; even from across the room. These microphones are Kuri’s ears.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-860 size-medium aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-05-at-1.32.15-PM-300x251.png" alt="" width="300" height="251" /></p>
<p>This innovative hardware is how Kuri captures the sound around her. However, those sounds must be interpreted, understood, and executed upon &mdash; which is where stellar software comes into play.</p>
<p><b>Ability to Understand</b><br />
Even though Kuri doesn&#8217;t speak back in English (Kuri speaks robot &mdash; adorable <i>beeps</i> and <i>boops</i>), she understands voice commands. If the microphones are Kuri&#8217;s ears, then the software is similar to the part of the brain that converts sounds into actionable meaning.</p>
<p>With thanks to the Houndify platform, Kuri can understand a range of voice commands straight out of the box, without any training.</p>
<p><b>Today&#8217;s Listening Technologies</b><br />
Many traditional devices that operate through voice commands use a multi-step process. First, these devices recognize speech and convert it to a text file. Then, they use that text file to interpret try to understand what the voice command is saying or requesting. This multi-step approach can be slower and less reliable &mdash; simply because there are more opportunities for error.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-847" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/traditional_approach_1-1024x374.jpg" alt="Infographic of traditional approach to AI hearing" width="618" height="226" /></p>
<p>In contrast, because her hearing software is powered by Houndify, Kuri&#8217;s software and technology blends the hearing and interpretation into a single step, improving reaction speed and improving consistency and accuracy. (<i>No, this technology upgrade isn’t available for humans &mdash; sorry</i>)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-848" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/houndify_2-1024x376.jpg" alt="Infographic of Houndify's AI hearing revisited" width="618" height="227" /></p>
<p>Kuri&#8217;s hardware and software work together to allow her to hear voice commands and thoughtfully respond to you and the world around her. This responsiveness helps Kuri maintain her delightful personality, and become an adorable addition to your home.</p>

This time last year, we introduced our adorable home robot to the world at <a href="/blog/meet-kuri-one-many-robots-debuting-ces-2017-usa-today/">CES</a>. Since then, we&#8217;ve launched new product features (like <a href="/blog/new-romojis-personality/">new romojis</a>, <a href="/blog/introducing-kuri-vision-never-miss-moment/">Kuri Vision</a>, <a href="/blog/kuri-entertains-dance-moves/">dancing</a>,and <a href="/blog/kuri-update/">self-charging</a>), <a href="/blog/kuri-on-the-today-show/">been on TV</a>, and have now started shipping robots to our first wave of pre-order customers! Here are some of our favorite moments with Kuri from 2017:</p>

<p>Time flies, and it&#8217;s easy to miss the little moments that made the year special. That&#8217;s why one of the best things Kuri can do is to <a href="/blog/introducing-kuri-vision-never-miss-moment/">capture her own moments</a> as well. Below is a screenshot from the Kuri app showcasing the kind of moments she could capture around your own home.</p>
<div id="attachment_800" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-800" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kuri_app_-_home_tab_1024-576x1024.png" alt="Sample of Kuri moments in the Kuri app" width="576" height="1024" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sample of Kuri moments in the Kuri app</p></div>
<p>With Kuri in your home, you&#8217;ll capture unexpected moments like hilarious pet antics, your reaction to the next jaw-dropping episode of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, kids playing together, your household cheering during the Super Bowl, and so much more. Kuri sends these moments to you through a daily dose of ten, five-second &#8216;life at home&#8217; videos that are shared through the Kuri app. You can store these videos in the Kuri app’s cloud, or save them directly to your smartphone.</p>
<p>Teaching Kuri to capture moments you care about is as simple as telling her which ones you like. As you &#8220;favorite&#8221; moments, Kuri learns which people, pets, and places you want to see. For example, you might tend to &#8220;favorite&#8221; moments taken between 5-6pm in your home’s kitchen area. Over time, Kuri may start camping out in this area of your home at this time to try and replicate some of those moments for you, like cooking together or weekly family game nights.</p>
<p>2017 was huge year for us, and the sky&#8217;s the limit for 2018. With more and more Kuris finding their way home, we&#8217;re excited for our customers to smile and laugh at the unique moments Kuri will capture in their own homes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kuri isn&#8217;t a ferocious guard dog &mdash; just look at him, he&#8217;s too cute! We often get asked if Kuri is a home security robot, and the answer is &#8216;not really&#8217;. Instead, we typically like to say Kuri provides <i>home awareness</i>. It&#8217;s less about constant surveillance, and more about checking in exactly when and where you need to.</p>
<p>At 20 inches tall, Kuri won&#8217;t scare away an intruder. Building robots is incredibly complex, and a robot like Kuri wasn&#8217;t designed to fully protect a home. Instead, Kuri was designed to be adorable and helpful, and provide a spark of life to your home &mdash; especially when you&#8217;re spending time at home with him. It&#8217;s exciting that Kuri is helping define <a href="/blog/what-is-a-home-robot/">what a home robot should be</a>, and we&#8217;ve found that a little bit of home awareness goes a long way towards peace of mind.</p>
<p>Today, our adorable home robot has a <a href="/explore-kuri/">1080p HD camera</a> and can move autonomously throughout your home, or you can drive him remotely using the app wherever you are. As always, Kuri captures videos around your home <i>when</i> and <i>where</i> you allow him to explore.</p>
<p>From a security standpoint, this means you can check on your home while you&#8217;re away by remotely driving Kuri to greet family and friends who might be at your house, see what your pet is up to in real-time, check if you left the lights on, and more. <b>That&#8217;s the key difference with Kuri: you&#8217;re in control</b>, unlike a security system that&#8217;s always watching and recording.</p>
<p>So, Kuri won&#8217;t be defending Fort Knox anytime soon, but that&#8217;s totally ok. He was designed to be a home robot, and he&#8217;ll stay focused on being the best (and most adorable) home robot that he can be.</p>
<p>Whatever your connected home setup includes, adding a Kuri to your home will only make your home smarter, and Kuri will happily fit into any security ecosystem that makes you and your loved ones feel safe and secure in the comforts of your home.</p>
