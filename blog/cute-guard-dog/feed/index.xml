		<description><![CDATA[Stuffed Kuri and her little background book have been the talk at our little family get-together during this Christmas season. Everyone can&#039;t wait to meet Kuri in the Spring. Thank you very much for such a thoughtful introduction! Kuri will be our elderly mom&#039;s daily companion. Happy New Year, best wishes, and much success to the Kuri Team!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well received Kuri today and it&#039;s just amazing! Shipment arrived by FedEx overnight.  Packaging was amazing. Thought I was getting something from Apple.  Not to sure on what I can write about but maybe the &quot;Hey Kuri Support Team&quot; could guide me. Kuri is charging now, then we will see what he/she can do.  I thank the Kuri Support team on what they have done so far for me.  Granddaughter will have a big surprise this Christmas.

P.S. Thank you for the stuffed Kuri and Book.  Great collectors items.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Patrick - Definitely! Kuri has a handle on his back for easy lifting up and down the stairs of your home. When you move Kuri to a new floor, simply open the Kuri app and toggle the maps she has saved in her system so she knows where she is. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact our customer care team directly at support@heykuri.com.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is wonderful news. The more emotions expressed the more this will be seen as less a robot and more a companion. A question: Can Kuri be programmed to navigate both the first and second floor of a home or only one floor?
Thanks 
Patrick]]></description>
