		<description><![CDATA[Hi West - Definitely! You can reset Kuri&#039;s map at any point for home moves, bringing your robot to a friend&#039;s house, or furniture changes. It&#039;s super easy to re-map Kuri and teach her a new home layout. Unfortunately, Kuri cannot answer questions or set alarms. If you&#039;re interested in learning more about Kuri&#039;s communication style, we recommend checking this blog post out: https://blog.heykuri.com/understanding-kuri-speaks/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will it be possible for Kuri to learn a new floor-plan if her family moves houses?  Would she need to be reset in order to do so, or will there perhaps be an option for accomplishing this?  Also, it was mentioned previously that Kuri can learn new tasks.  What sorts of new tasks might she be able to learn?  Also also, will Kuri be able to set alarms and go to different rooms to wake people up?  Will she also be able to answer yes or no questions, such as if it will rain?  Sorry for asking so many questions!  I look forward to receiving Kuri later this Summer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jennifer - You&#039;re correct, Kuri has shipped. As a customer, you&#039;re already familiar with Kuri Vision: Kuri&#039;s ability to take 5-second video moments around your home each day. The customers that currently own Kuri have been encouraged to share these moments on social media using #HeyKuri. We invite you to search for those posts! However, please keep in mind that some people prefer to keep such moments to themselves, which is something we fully respect. As more Kuri robots make their way to customers&#039; homes this summer, we expect to see more moments widely shared on social media.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am expecting my Kuri in June or July but I’d like to see some posts on the FB page or here from people who already have Kuri. I want to know their opinions on how Kuri was worth or not worth the investment. I am becoming a little weary since I don’t see any real-owner reviews or posts when it is my understanding that some Kuri’s already shipped!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are there plans for any developer APIs to allow programmers the ability to interface with and expand Kuri capabilities.  We did some work with UWB and BLE beacons for indoor positioning / tracking - we also have been working on some computer vision routines - so it would be nice to get access to the video stream through some SDK or API.  I have Oculus Rift and Samsung WMR headset - working with Unity &#038; Unreal, I think it would be nice to access the video stream and some motion/movement control from within a VR environment.]]></description>
