		<description><![CDATA[Hi Joyce, You can customize the hours that Kuri is active within your home - which includes capturing Kuri Vision moments. That being said, if Kuri is inactive then she is charging on her dock, which doesn&#039;t make for a very useful robot - so totally up to you and your preferences!

Plus, you can customize &quot;no-go&quot; zones in the Kuri Robot app. You can tell Kuri that you don&#039;t want her to go into the bathroom or bedroom (which most of our customers do), to avoid capturing such moments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That could be an issue.  I would not want Kuri imaging me in the bathroom, showering, changing clothes.  In this day when hackers can watch people through the laptop camera, I would not want them watching 24/7 through Kuri.  Should be a voice activated &quot;turn off imaging for next X minutes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Edward! At this time, Kuri is not able to perform those specific tasks. We&#039;re really proud of the robust home robot we&#039;re launching today, and we&#039;re hopeful we can dream up all sorts of awesome product features (like the ones you mentioned) someday in the future. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can Kuri detect health issues and phone emergency contacts with two way video communication? 
Can it act like a PC? 
Can it project its video onto a wall or through your TV? 
Can it stream Video and TV? 
Am I asking too much abilities yet for a home robot? 
I hope not. 
Thank you for this way to ask you questions. 
Maybe you could incorporate a projector in Kuri&#039;s other eye.]]></description>
